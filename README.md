My new enemy(well, my old one too) time.

I've been doing my best to get this projects done with the things in my life that I can't currently control.

That being said, mysql is a heck ton of fun.

I've enjoyed it in every setting that we've done it in class.

This project isn't pretty by any measure of the word, but I've done what I can when I could do it.

A bit challenging, but with what I've been able to put into it... also simple.

Regardless, better times on this one than on projects in the last week, more time and all that.

STEPS TO COMPLETION:
1. Setting up tables in mysql.
2. Connecting VS code to sql server.
3. Setting up initial prompt to get input to return in mysql.
4. Added other prompts just to be able to see them.
5. Made sure user would be able to keep adding things after completing one prompt if they so desired.
6. Troubleshooting and fixing broken prompts that weren't posting info to tables.
7. Fixing minor bugs and tricky placements of code that were causing trouble.

Still not my best work. But things are normalizing to the point that I can spend a considerable amount of time on future projects.
